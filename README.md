## Python-pw5
## TASK: Using Visual Studio Code environment write Python program with latter mentioned requirements.

5.2.1. Use Fish and Bear simulated world and the accordant code (Fish, Bear, Plant and World
classes) introduced in our lecture material (i.e. 5.2. Part material).
[a] Modify the
mainSimulation function to create two lists. One list will keep track of the number of fish that
are alive in each time unit, and the other will keep track of the number of bears. When the
simulation is done, this data should be written to a file. The file should have three columns: one
column for the time, one for the number of fish, and one for the number of bears.
[b] Two events
can cause a Bear to die: starvation and energy level dropping to 0. Develop accordant energy
representing instance variable in class Bear and set the initial energy level (i.e. integer). Update
accordingly class Bear to decrease energy level if bear is breeding or moving, and increase
energy level if bear is eating. Bear is dead if energy level drops below 0.

Load all the necessary classes and run the Fish and Bear simulation. In description document
include runtime screenshots of above solutions.
